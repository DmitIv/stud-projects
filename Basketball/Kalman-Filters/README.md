# Kalman-Filters
 Kalman filtering, also known as linear quadratic estimation (LQE), is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements observed over time, containing statistical noise and other inaccuracies, and produces estimates of unknown variables that tend to be more accurate than those based on a single measurement alone, by estimating a joint probability distribution over the variables for each timeframe. The filter is named after Rudolf E. Kálmán, one of the primary developers of its theory.
 
Let's take the case of a robot that moves through the world. As a robot moves through the world it locates itself by performing a cycle of:

sensing and performing a measurement update and
moving and performing a motion update

How to run:

1. Open Jupyter Notebook in your browser
2. Open  1D Kalman Filter, solution.ipynb 
3. Run each block one by one.
